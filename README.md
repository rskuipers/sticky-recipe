# Don't Starve Sticky Recipe
Makes a recipe sticky to remind you what you are working on. 

Click the sticky button in the recipe popup and a windowless popup will appear on the right side from which you can also click build. 
Very useful to keep track of how much you've gathered and remind you what you're gathering for.
